I mainly write web applications using **C#** and **JavaScript**. I'm passionate about best practices and aim to write clean and understandable code.

I'm an advocate for agile teams that build and operate quality software with CI/CD and constant refactoring.

I'm a visual learner - you'll often find me drawing boxes and arrows.
