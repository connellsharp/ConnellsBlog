I mainly write web applications using **C#** and **JavaScript**. I'm passionate about best practices, focus on object design and aim to write clean and understandable code.

I'm an advocate for agile teams that build and operate quality software with CI/CD and constant refactoring.

I like to visualise architectural boundaries and believe abstraction and encapsulation are important at all levels.

I have a few open-source libraries I like to build on the side.
